Nora is a fullstack developer, that dreams of big data and great user experiences. In 2015 she co-founded the Oslo Kodeklubb and has been a part of the task force of Lær Kidsa Koding since. She is currently a consultant at Embriq, where she has gotten the chance to do quite a lot of database related work on in-house projects in the energy sector.
