title: A yearly conference celebrating underrepresented folks in Tech in Norway
---

AdaCon Norway is proud to announce the return of its conference in 2023,
celebrating the diversity of the Norwegian tech scene. The event, which was
formerly done as a part of [Tech Women Norway](https://techwomen.no/) will now
go by the name AdaCon. We believe that diversity efforts have to go along more
axis than gender, and that we need to acknowledge that this work is
intersectional. Our new name reflects this commitment.

The event will be held on Ada Lovelace Day as before, which is the second
Tuesday in October every year. This year it falls on Tuesday October 10th. Our
venue is Rebel, Universitetsgata 2, 0164 Oslo.

AdaCon Norway aims to promote and empower under-indexed people in tech by
showcasing a lineup of speakers from diverse backgrounds.
