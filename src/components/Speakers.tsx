									We plan a full day conference with talks and workshops. We are
									looking for members of the tech-scene in Norway that are
									hands-on creators, builders, and makers of technology. We want
									to see those who love to share about a topic or a project that
									matters to them and that the audience will benefit from
									learning about. We do not care about experience as a speaker.
									We will pair all our speakers with a personal coach to help
									prepare for the event.
